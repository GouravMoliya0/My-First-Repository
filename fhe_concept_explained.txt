# Understanding Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

- FHE is a cryptographic method that allows computations on encrypted data without decrypting it.
- It preserves privacy while still enabling useful operations.
- Zama AI brings FHE to the Ethereum ecosystem through FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine).

Example idea:
Encrypted inputs → Smart Contract executes → Encrypted outputs

This means even blockchain nodes cannot see the actual data.
