# Common Challenges Developers Face with Zama FHEVM

1. **Performance Overhead**
   - FHE computations are slower than normal EVM operations.

2. **Complex Debugging**
   - Since data is encrypted, traditional debugging tools canâ€™t read values.

3. **Limited Tooling**
   - Ecosystem is still growing; few frameworks fully support FHE yet.

4. **Learning Curve**
   - Understanding encryption concepts takes time for new developers.

5. **Deployment Costs**
   - Encrypted operations can require more gas on-chain.
